## 🔥 The Legend of JP

Legend has it that JP was born during a solar eclipse while a comet passed overhead. The nurses swear his first words weren't "mama" or "dada" but "Hello World!" As a child, he could debug BASIC code before learning to tie his shoelaces.

Some say he once fixed a critical production bug using only a paper clip and pure willpower. Others claim he can read binary just by looking at it. All we know is... he's JP.

## 🧠 The JP Principle

Every coding problem can be solved by:

1. **P**rocrastinating just the right amount
2. **E**xploring Stack Overflow thoroughly
3. **T**rying random solutions until one works
4. **E**xplaining the problem to an inanimate object
5. **R**efactoring everything unnecessarily
6. **M**aking more coffee
7. **A**sking ChatGPT for help
8. **N**ever admitting how the bug was actually fixed

1. When faced with a bug, you:
   - A) Google the error message immediately
   - B) Step through with a debugger methodically
   - C) Add console.log() statements everywhere
   - D) Stare at the code until it surrenders

2. Your preferred work hours are:
   - A) 9-5, like a normal human
