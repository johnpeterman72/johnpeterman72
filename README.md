## ðŸ§  The JP Principle

Every coding problem can be solved by:

1. **P**rocrastinating just the right amount
2. **E**xploring Stack Overflow thoroughly
3. **T**rying random solutions until one works
4. **E**xplaining the problem to an inanimate object
5. **R**efactoring everything unnecessarily
6. **M**aking more coffee
7. **A**sking ChatGPT for help (If you ask Claude, it will just delete all your code and call you stupid)
8. **N**ever admitting how the bug was actually fixed
